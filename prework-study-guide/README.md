# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This webpage started off as a pre course assigment but has turned into so much more then that, in the beging there was a basic outline of what an HTML document should look like but throughout the couse I was able to learn how to add many different aspects to it. Some of these aspects were adding more HTML code to the file along with learning and adding CSS to it followed by adding JavaScript as well. Durring each section I was able to learn more and more about each one of these languages and how they all interact with each other. Now that this web page is created there is a clear space where the information that I learned can now be stored and referenced at any time.

## Usage

This web page is used as a reference point to understand the topics that were covered during my pre course learning experience. This page has valuable notes/ key points that I found during the process. Each section has its own box where it talked about in just a few bullet point, but the JavaScript section has a litle bit more then just thoes words. If you open up the DevTools console you are able to see the JavaScript code that is linked to the HTML file and are able to see what section were covered and randomly generate a topic to study at that time.
